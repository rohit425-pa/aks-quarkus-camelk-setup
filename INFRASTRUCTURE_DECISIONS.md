# Infrastructure Decisions & Configuration Summary

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Project**: Enterprise AKS + Quarkus + Camel K Platform  
**Environment**: Azure Cloud

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the key infrastructure decisions made during the enterprise AKS setup with Quarkus and Apache Camel K integration. The decisions balance enterprise requirements with practical implementation considerations, resulting in a scalable, cost-effective platform ready for production workloads.

## Infrastructure Architecture Decisions

### 1. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Configuration

#### Cluster Sizing Decision
```
Decision: Standard_B2s (1 node) instead of Standard_D4s_v3 (3 nodes)
Rationale: Cost optimization while maintaining functionality
Impact: 70% cost reduction, suitable for development/demo workloads
```

**Decision Matrix**:
| Aspect | Enterprise Original | Implemented | Justification |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **VM Size** | Standard_D4s_v3 (4 vCPU, 16GB) | Standard_B2s (2 vCPU, 4GB) | Cost optimization, sufficient for demo |
| **Node Count** | 3 nodes | 1 node | Reduced complexity, lower cost |
| **Location** | East US 2 | West US 2 | Resource availability |
| **Network** | Azure CNI | kubenet | Simplified networking, faster setup |

#### Resource Group Strategy
```
Resource Group: rg-aks-quarkus-camelk-west
Naming Convention: rg-{service}-{project}-{region}
Tagging Strategy: Environment=development, Project=AKS-Quarkus-CamelK
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear resource organization
- Cost tracking by project
- Environment separation capability
- Consistent naming convention

### 2. Container Registry (ACR) Integration

#### Registry Configuration
```
Registry Name: aksquarkuscamelkwest234.azurecr.io
SKU: Basic
Authentication: Integrated with AKS cluster
Image Policy: No retention policies (development)
```

**Key Decisions**:
- **Basic SKU**: Cost-effective for single-region deployment
- **Integrated Auth**: Simplified image pull authentication
- **Naming Strategy**: Descriptive name with random suffix for uniqueness

### 3. Networking Architecture

#### Network Plugin Selection
```
Selected: kubenet
Alternative: Azure CNI
Rationale: Simplified setup, lower resource requirements
```

**Comparison Analysis**:
| Feature | kubenet (Selected) | Azure CNI |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Pod IP Space** | NAT-based | Azure subnet IPs |
| **Setup Complexity** | Low | High |
| **Resource Usage** | Lower | Higher |
| **Enterprise Features** | Basic | Advanced |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |

#### Security Configuration
```
Network Policies: Not enabled (kubenet limitation)
Private Cluster: Disabled (public endpoints for demo)
Authorized IP Ranges: Not configured
```

### 4. Apache Camel K Operator Deployment

#### Installation Strategy
```
Method: Direct kubectl apply from GitHub releases
Version: v2.8.0 (latest stable)
Namespace: camel-k (dedicated namespace)
```

**Installation Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AKS Cluster               │
│                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │      camel-k namespace          ││
│  │  ┌─────────────────────────────┐││
│  │  │    Camel K Operator         │││

│  │  │  - Integration Platform     │││
│  │  │    ready                    │││
│  │  └─────────────────────────────┘││
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘│
│                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │      default namespace          ││
│  │  (Application deployment)       ││
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Operator Configuration
```yaml
Integration Platform: camel-k
Build Strategy: pod (for single-node cluster)
Registry Integration: ACR configured
Supported Runtimes: Quarkus, Spring Boot, Camel Main
```

## Development Environment Decisions

### 1. Java Runtime Selection

#### Version Strategy
```
Development: Java 17 (OpenJDK)
Production: Java 17 (Red Hat UBI 8)
Rationale: LTS support, Quarkus compatibility, container optimization
```

**Version Matrix**:
| Java Version | Quarkus Support | Container Size | Performance | Decision |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Java 11 | ✅ Full | Smaller | Good | ❌ Older LTS |
| Java 17 | ✅ Full | Medium | Better | ✅ **Selected** |
| Java 21 | ⚠️ Limited | Larger | Best | ❌ Too new |

### 2. Build Tool Configuration

#### Maven Setup
```
Version: 3.9.5
Configuration: Standard settings
Repository: Maven Central
Cache Strategy: Local cache enabled
```

**Build Architecture**:
```
Local Development → Maven Build → Docker Image → ACR → AKS
     ↓               ↓            ↓              ↓      ↓
  Source Code    JAR Artifact   Container    Registry  K8s Pod
```

### 3. Container Strategy

#### Base Image Selection
```
Selected: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.20
Alternative: eclipse-temurin:17-jre
Rationale: Enterprise support, security updates, optimized for containers
```

**Image Comparison**:
| Base Image | Size | Security | Support | Enterprise Ready |
|------------|------|----------|---------|------------------|
| **UBI 8 OpenJDK 17** | Medium | ✅ High | ✅ Red Hat | ✅ **Selected** |
| Eclipse Temurin | Small | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Community | ❌ |
| Alpine OpenJDK | Smallest | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Community | ❌ |

## Operational Decisions

### 1. Monitoring & Observability

#### Health Check Strategy
```
Framework: SmallRye Health (Quarkus native)
Endpoints: /q/health, /q/health/live, /q/health/ready
Monitoring: Built-in Prometheus metrics
Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger UI
```

#### Observability Stack
```
Metrics: Prometheus-compatible (Quarkus built-in)
Health: Kubernetes probes integration
Logging: Structured JSON logging
Tracing: Ready for Jaeger integration
```

### 2. Security Considerations

#### Current Security Posture
```
Pod Security: Standard user (non-root)
Network Security: Default Kubernetes networking
Image Security: Trusted Red Hat base images
Secrets: Kubernetes secrets for ACR integration
```

#### Future Security Enhancements
```
- Pod Security Standards enforcement
- Network policies implementation
- RBAC configuration
- Image scanning integration
- Secret management with Azure Key Vault
```

### 3. Scaling & Performance

#### Resource Allocation Strategy
```
Initial Limits: None set (development mode)
CPU Request: To be determined based on load testing
Memory Request: To be determined based on application profiling
Scaling: Manual initially, HPA for production
```

#### Performance Optimization
```
Quarkus: Native image compilation ready
Container: Multi-stage build optimization available
JVM: Tuned startup parameters
Caching: Maven dependency caching implemented
```

## Cost Optimization Decisions

### 1. Resource Sizing
```
Approach: Right-sizing for workload
Current Cost: ~$50/month (single B2s node)
Enterprise Scale: ~$300/month (3x D4s_v3 nodes)
Savings: 83% cost reduction for development phase
```

### 2. Service Tier Selection
```
AKS: Free tier control plane
ACR: Basic tier
Storage: Standard locally redundant
Networking: Standard public IPs
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 1. Single Node Risk
```
Risk: Single point of failure
Mitigation: Easy to scale to multiple nodes
Timeline: Before production deployment
Cost: Additional $50/month per node
```

### 2. Basic ACR Limitations
```
Risk: Limited enterprise features (geo-replication, webhooks)
Mitigation: Upgrade to Standard tier when needed
Timeline: Pre-production
Cost: Additional $20/month
```

### 3. kubenet Networking Limitations
```
Risk: Limited network policy support
Mitigation: Migrate to Azure CNI if needed
Timeline: Based on security requirements
Impact: Cluster recreation required
```

## Success Metrics

### 1. Infrastructure KPIs
```
✅ Cluster Creation Time: < 10 minutes
✅ Application Deployment Time: < 5 minutes (projected)
✅ Service Availability: 99.9% target
✅ Build Time: 57 seconds (achieved)
```

### 2. Cost Metrics
